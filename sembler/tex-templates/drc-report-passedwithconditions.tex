\section{Output}
The DRC generated a ZIP file with feedback on your design. This ZIP file contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{$<$FILENAME$>$.pdf}: this report
\item \texttt{$<$FILENAME$>$.dxf}: your submitted design file
\item \texttt{$<$FILENAME$>$-output.dxf}: an ``output DXF'' file that contains your design with notation from the DRC
\end{itemize}
This report guides you in interpreting the DRC feedback.

\section{Design status}
\subsection*{PASSED WITH CONDITIONS}
Your design has features that exceed one or more of the Design Guidelines (see
\href{https://sembler.draper.com/files/sembler_process_rules.pdf}{Sembler Design
  Rules and Process Description (PDF)}). Sembler can fabricate your device, but
you assume some additional risk that the device might not function as you
intend. To mitigate this risk, edit and resubmit your design until it passes the
Design Rule Check with fewer or no conditions.

For more information, review the reported warnings and the checkplots in this
document, as well as the output DXF file. If you require assistance, contact

\subsection{General design issues}
\subsubsection{Invalid port diameter}
\par A port in VERTICAL\_PORT has a diameter that is not one of the specified
acceptable values. Only 1 mm, 2 mm, or 3 mm (1000 $\mu$m, 2000 $\mu$m, or 3000
$\mu$m) diameter holes can be punched. Ports that have other diameters will not
be punched.  \par See WARN\_DIAMETER\_VERTICAL\_PORT layer in output DXF file.

\subsubsection{Minimum port perimeter-to-perimeter distance not met}
\par Ports are closer to each other than the recommended minimum distance. The
minimum recommended distance between ports, from perimeter to perimeter, is 2 mm
(2000 $\mu$m). Placing ports closer together than this minimum distance might
result in poor bonding and fluid leakage.  \par See
WARN\_MIN\_DIST\_EDGE2EDGE\_VERTICAL\_PORT layer in output DXF file.

\subsubsection{Minimum distance from port perimeter to die edge not met}
\par A fluidic port is closer to the edge of the die than the recommended
minimum distance. The minimum recommended distance between the die boundary and
the perimeter of a port used for fluidics is 2 mm (2000 $\mu$m).  \par See
WARN\_MIN\_DIST\_DIE\_BOUNDARY\_EDGE\_VERTICAL\_PORT\_FLC layer in output DXF
file.

\subsubsection{Minimum support post diameter for L1\_SU8 not met}
\par A support post for an L1\_SU8 feature has a diameter that is smaller than
the recommended minimum diameter. The minimum recommended diameter for support
posts for L1\_SU8 features is 20 $\mu$m. Note that the DRC automatically maps
support posts to the SU-8 layers where features exist.  \par See
WARN\_MIN\_DIAMETER\_SUPPORT\_POST\_L1\_SU8 layer in output DXF file.

%% Not covered by any rule
\subsubsection{Maximum distance between support posts in L1\_SU8 exceeded}
Support posts for L1\_SU8 features are farther away from each other than the
recommended maximum distance. The maximum recommended distance between support
posts for L1\_SU8 features, from edge to edge, is 80 $\mu$m. Note that the DRC
automatically maps support posts to the SU-8 layers where features exist.  \par
See WARN\_MAX\_DIST\_EDGE2EDGE\_SUPPORT\_POST\_L1\_SU8 layer in output DXF file.

\subsubsection{Minimum support post diameter for L2\_SU8 not met}
\par A support post for an L2\_SU8 feature has a diameter that is smaller than
the recommended minimum diameter. The minimum recommended diameter for support
posts for L2\_SU8 features is 50 $\mu$m. Note that the DRC automatically maps
support posts to the SU-8 layers where features exist, and that the total height
of L2\_SU8 features is the combined thickness of L1\_SU8 and L2\_SU8.  \par See
WARN\_MIN\_DIAMETER\_SUPPORT\_POST\_L2\_SU8 layer in output DXF file.

%% Not covered by any rule
\subsubsection{Maximum distance between support posts in L2\_SU8 exceeded}
Support posts for L2\_SU8 features are farther away from each other than the
recommended maximum distance. The maximum recommended distance between support
posts for L2\_SU8 features, from edge to edge, is 200 $\mu$m. Note that the DRC
automatically maps support posts to the SU-8 layers where features exist, and
that the total height of L2\_SU8 features is the combined thickness of L1\_SU8
and L2\_SU8.  \par See WARN\_MAX\_DIST\_EDGE2EDGE\_SUPPORT\_POST\_L2\_SU8 layer
in output DXF file.

\subsubsection{Minimum support post diameter for L3\_SU8 not met}
\par A support post for an L3\_SU8 feature has a diameter that is smaller than
the recommended minimum diameter. The minimum recommended diameter for support
posts for L3\_SU8 features is 100 $\mu$m. Note that the DRC automatically maps
support posts to the SU-8 layers where features exist, and that the total height
of L3\_SU8 features is the combined thickness of L1\_SU8, L2\_SU8, and L3\_SU8.
\par See WARN\_MIN\_DIAMETER\_SUPPORT\_POST\_L3\_SU8 layer in output DXF file.

%% Not covered by any rule
\subsubsection{Maximum distance between support posts in L3\_SU8 exceeded}
Support posts for L3\_SU8 features are farther away from each other than the
recommended maximum distance. The maximum recommended distance between support
posts for L3\_SU8 features, from edge to edge, is 400 $\mu$m. Note that the DRC
automatically maps support posts to the SU-8 layers where features exist, and
that the total height of L3\_SU8 features is the combined thickness of L1\_SU8,
L2\_SU8, and L3\_SU8.  \par See
WARN\_MAX\_DIST\_EDGE2EDGE\_SUPPORT\_POST\_L3\_SU8 layer in output DXF file.

\subsubsection{Incorrect number of alignment mark groupings}
\par The design does not have the recommended number of alignment marks. For
devices with a dimension larger than 2 cm (20000 $\mu$m), two groupings of
alignment marks in opposite corners are recommended. To see the standard
grouping of three alignment marks in the proper configuration (triangular
pattern with no more than two co-linear), download the Sembler template files
and open a blank template.  \par See
WARN\_ARRANGEMENT\_ALIGNMENT\_MARK\_LARGE\_DIE layer in output DXF file.

\subsection{Issues in L0\_METAL}
\subsubsection{Minimum trace width not met}
\par A metal trace has a width smaller than the recommended minimum. The minimum
recommended metal trace width is 10 $\mu$m.  \par See
WARN\_MIN\_WIDTH\_FEATURE\_METAL layer in output DXF file.

\subsubsection{Minimum edge-to-edge distance not met}
\par Metal traces are closer to each other than the recommended minimum
distance. The minimum recommended distance between metal traces, from edge to
edge, is 10 $\mu$m.  \par See WARN\_MIN\_DIST\_EDGE2EDGE\_METAL layer in output
DXF file.

\subsubsection{Minimum bond pad width not met}
\par A metal bond pad has a width smaller than the recommended minimum. The
minimum recommended metal bond pad width is 100 $\mu$m.  \par See
WARN\_MIN\_WIDTH\_BONDPAD\_METAL layer in output DXF file.

\subsubsection{Minimum center-to-center distance not met}
\par Metal bond pads are closer to each other than the recommended minimum
distance. The minimum recommended distance between metal bond pads, from center
to center, is 500 $\mu$m.  \par See WARN\_MIN\_PITCH\_BONDPAD\_METAL layer in
output DXF file.

\subsection{Issues in L1\_SU8}
\subsubsection{Minimum feature width not met}
\par A feature in L1\_SU8 is narrower than the recommended minimum width. The
minimum recommended width of L1\_SU8 features is 10 $\mu$m. A feature narrower
than this might not resolve accurately.  \par See
WARN\_MIN\_WIDTH\_FEATURE\_L1\_SU8 layer in output DXF file.

\subsubsection{Maximum feature width exceeded}
\par A feature in L1\_SU8 is wider than the recommended maximum width. The
maximum recommended width of L1\_SU8 features is 80 $\mu$m. A feature wider than
this runs the risk of collapse. To help prevent this, narrow the feature or add
support posts.  \par See WARN\_MAX\_WIDTH \_FEATURE\_L1\_SU8 layer in output DXF
file.

\subsubsection{Minimum edge-to-edge distance not met}
\par Features in L1\_SU8 are closer to each other than the recommended minimum
distance. The minimum recommended distance between SU-8 features, from edge to
edge, is 50 $\mu$m to prevent risk of poor bonding and fluid leakage.  \par See
WARN\_MIN\_DIST\_EDGE2EDGE\_L1\_SU8 layer in output DXF file.

\subsubsection{Minimum distance from L1\_SU8 edge to port perimeter not met}
\par A feature in L1\_SU8 is closer to the perimeter of a port than the
recommended minimum distance. The minimum recommended distance between the
perimeter of a port and the edge of any SU-8 feature (except a channel entering
the port) is 1 mm (1000 $\mu$m).  \par See
WARN\_MIN\_DIST\_L1\_SU8\_EDGE\_VERTICAL\_PORT layer in output DXF file.

\subsubsection{Minimum distance from L1\_SU8 edge to die boundary not met}
\par A feature in L1\_SU8 (or an alignment mark in REF\_ALIGNMENT) is closer to

\section{Checkplots}
Review the checkplots for the SU-8 and metal layers to verify that the Design
Rule Checker correctly interprets your design.  \par Fluidic and metal features
appear in white, while substrate and bulk PDMS appear in gray. For reference,
ports and alignment marks are shown in each layer as black dashed lines. Note
also that the DRC automatically maps support posts to the SU-8 layers where
features exist.
